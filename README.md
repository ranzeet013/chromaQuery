# ChromaQuery

**ChromaQuery** is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that efficiently processes, stores, and queries PDF documents. By leveraging **ChromaDB** for vector storage and **Groq LLM** for advanced query responses, ChromaQuery can quickly retrieve relevant document passages and generate insightful answers to user queries.

## Features

- **PDF Document Processing**: Automatically extracts and splits text from large PDF files for efficient search.
- **Vector Storage**: Utilizes **ChromaDB** to store and retrieve document embeddings, ensuring fast and scalable document retrieval.
- **AI-Powered Query Engine**: Uses **Groq LLM** to answer queries based on the relevant document sections retrieved from the database.
- **Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines document retrieval with AI-driven answer generation, improving the quality of responses.

## Benefits

- **Fast Query Response**: Quickly retrieves relevant passages from PDFs based on user queries.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different document types and domains by changing the PDF input or fine-tuning the AI model.
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large volumes of documents, ideal for research, academic, or enterprise use cases.
- **Automated Knowledge Extraction**: Extracts valuable insights from documents automatically without manual intervention.

## Technologies Used

- **ChromaDB**: A vector database for efficient embedding storage and similarity search.
- **Sentence-Transformers**: A library for generating high-quality embeddings for text.
- **Groq LLM**: A large language model used for processing and generating intelligent responses to queries.
- **LangChain**: A framework to help with document loading, splitting, and processing.
- **PyPDF2 and PyMuPDF**: Libraries used to load and extract text from PDF files.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the required dependencies. You can do this using **pip**:

```bash
pip install openai langchain sentence_transformers chromadb pymupdf langchain_community langchain_groq pypdf
```

## Usages

1. Load PDF Documents
   The load_data.py script loads and processes PDF documents. You can specify the file path of your PDF document for processing. 
   ```bash
   python load_data.py
   ```
2. Create and Persist Vector Store
   The vector_store.py script generates document embeddings and stores them in ChromaDB. This step is essential for efficient document retrieval.
   ```bash
   python vector_store.py
   ```
3. Query Engine
   Once the vector store is created, you can query the database with query_engine.py to retrieve relevant document sections and generate responses. Simply input your query as a string.
   ```bash
   python query_engine.py "Your Query Here"
   ```
   The system will search through the embeddings stored in ChromaDB and provide a response generated by Groq LLM based on the relevant passages.
   
4.  Configuration
   The config.py file stores your API keys, settings for ChromaDB, and other configurations such as model names or query parameters.
   ```bash
   # Groq API Key for querying the model
     GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key"

   # ChromaDB configuration
     CHROMADB_PATH = "/path/to/store/chromadb"
   ```
## Example
Here is an example of how you can use ChromaQuery to ask a question based on the loaded PDF:

 - Load your PDF document into the system.
 - Create embeddings and store them in the vector store.
 - Ask a query like "What is the summary of the document?" or any other relevant question, and the system will provide an answer based on the document content.

```bash
   python query_engine.py "What are the key findings of the document?"
   ```
   The system will return the most relevant passages and a generated response that answers your query.

## Use case

- **Academic Research**: Extract key insights from academic papers, articles, and research documents.
- **Document Search**: Quickly find relevant information across large collections of PDF documents.
- **Automated Q&A**: Build intelligent question-answering systems based on document content.
- **Legal and Compliance**: Automatically search through legal documents or contracts to find specific clauses or references.
